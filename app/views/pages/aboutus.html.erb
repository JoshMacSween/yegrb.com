<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
    YEGRB is a (very) small, volunteer run outfit with the goal growing the number and skills of people
    working with the Ruby programming language. By hosting a monthly meetup and running this website
    we want to be a resource for our small but talented community of Edmontonian Ruby developers.

    If you are interested helping out, even in a small way, then <%= link_to 'Get Involved!', getinvolved_path %>
    We will be happy to hear from you.
