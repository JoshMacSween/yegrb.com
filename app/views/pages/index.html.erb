            YEGRB is Edmontonâ€™s local Ruby Meetup. Ruby is a dynamic,
            open source programming language with a focus on simplicity
            and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural
            to read and easy to write.
        </p>
        <p>
            This meetup is held monthly for
            people of all abilities and backgrounds who share one thing:
            an interest in the language that was designed for humans first.
        </p>
